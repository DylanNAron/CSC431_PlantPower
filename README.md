# CSC431_PlantPower

This is a project for CSC 431 - Intro to Software Engineering at the University of Miami. We are Team 15: Jorge Jaime-Rivera, Dylan Aron, and Dominick Bello.

Plant Power is designed to allow for automation of growing plants through an arduino to a machine learning backend and then to a beautiful webpage.
The objective of this project is to create a system for data visualization of plant conditions, which can then be used to predict optimal conditions. 
The main concept is that the plant, grown hydroponically, will have sensors attached to it that will be collecting data and log them onto a database. 
These conditions will then be extracted from the database and displayed on a user-friendly interface through a web application built on React.
